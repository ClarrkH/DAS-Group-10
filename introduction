Introducion

Obesity is a multifaceted public health concern which not only poses individual health risks but also reflects broader
societal patterns influenced by various factors. The Scottish Health Surveys from 2008 to 2012 gathered data on a variety 
of socio economic and lifestyle factors, providing a comprehensive picture of the general health of the country during this 
period.
Using this dataset our goal is to uncover the trends and factors contributing to obesity in scotland. Specifically we want to analyse 
if the prevalence of obesity has changed over the given years and if there are any differences in obesity by age, gender and the highest
educational qualification of the individual.

@sec-EA consists of exploratory analysis of the obesity data and explores the potential relationship between prevalance of 
obesity and time as well as an potential impact age, sex, and education have on obesity.

@sec-FA contains the results from fitting multiple logistic regression models to answer our questions of interest, which we can thenuse
to draw our conclusoions.
