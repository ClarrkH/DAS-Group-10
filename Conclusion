conclusion

In conclusion, From @sec-EA and @sec-FA we can conclude that the prevalence of obesity has not changed over the years given in the data. We can also see that there are no differences in obesity levels by gender. However, we have observed that there is a higher prevelence of obesity in older people than younger people and that there are differeing obesity rates depenign on the highest educational qualification an individual as attained.
